# HousePricePrediction

Introduction
In this exercise, you will create and submit predictions for a Kaggle competition. You can then improve your model (e.g. by adding features) to apply what you've learned and move up the leaderboard.

Begin by running the code cell below to set up code checking and the filepaths for the dataset.

Train a model for the competition
The code cell above trains a Random Forest model on train_X and train_y.

Use the code cell below to build a Random Forest model and train it on all of X and y.
